 * This class is used by the application's controller to receive the tickets sent by the timeclock
 * It's attributes are a server socket listening a specified tcp port on the localhost address,
 * an object input stream which takes the role of an input buffer in which objects could be readen
 * and the sending socket. This class specializes the Thread class because the server sockets needs to turn as background task
 * and would block the application if it was not managed on another thread. The last attribute is an arrayList of ticket
 * initialized later by the mainframeController
